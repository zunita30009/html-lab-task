  <h2>Why I Chose Biomedical Engineering</h2>
  <p>I chose Biomedical Engineering because it combines medicine and engineering. It allows me to design devices that can improve healthcare and make life easier for patients.</p>
  <h2>What Fascinates Me</h2>
  <p>I am fascinated by medical devices like prosthetic limbs, biosensors, and imaging machines. These devices show how engineering can directly change lives.</p>

  <h2>My Plans During This Degree</h2>
  <p>By the end of my degree, I plan to build a small project such as a wearable health monitor or a simple biosensor. This will help me apply what I learn in real life.</p>
